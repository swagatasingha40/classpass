                academic journey. Our goal is to
                provide a supportive tool that enhances learning and aids in completing assignments, but it's crucial to
                use our
                platform ethically. Here’s how to maintain academic integrity while using Classpass:

                        meant to be a study tool that supports your educational growth. It’s ideal for double-checking
                        your
                        work, exploring alternative methods, and finding guidance when you're truly struggling.
                        Remember, it's a resource for
                        learning, not a replacement for it.
